# WpfMotionDetector
A WPF application that detects motion and uses object recognition with a webcam to draw red boxes around the moving object(s). Optionally saves each frame to a local directory, and then uploads that directory to Azure Blob Storage when the camera is stopped - then deletes the local directory.
